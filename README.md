# Myhood

Myhood is a simple web application for people to stay on the loop with what is happening in their neigborhoods. Once registered and logged in, a user can join one of the many neighborhoods created by other users, or create a new neighborhood. As a member of a neihborhood, a user can see updates posted by other members of the same neighborhood. These could include new businesses in the neighborhood and othe general information that might be important. A user can also create a new updates for other members to see, and can post new businesses as well. A user can leave one neighborhood and join a different neighborhood, but cannot be a member of two neighborhoods at the same time.
